# ComputeTOT

The TimeOnTaskCompute mechanism which is
proposed automatically computes task-dependent
threshold values for the ToT metric based on the
game-playing related data and EEG signals. This
uses the detection of Engagement and Motivation
using EEG(Electroencephalography). The
algorithm to calculate the threshold value uses the
Engagement logs databses and the Game playing
Database.
